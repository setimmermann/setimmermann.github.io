           In March 2020, as the World Health Organization proclaimed a global pandemic, countries around the world started to shut down their borders in an effort to contain the spread of the novel virus.

         In New Mexico, the home of Dan and Nancy, it was at the earlier stages of the virus. The governor had just prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people and with new announcements luring no one could be sure how long registries would remain open. 


          <br />
          <br /> 

           “This corona thing really messed up all of our plans. Everyone was stressed out, because it was the first week with the first few cases in New Mexico”, Dan recalls.

          <br />
          <br />

         When the courthouse official cancelled, Dan and Nancy had to think fast knowing they didn’t want to push back the wedding. They liked the date, a Friday, and that it represented the beginning of spring. But mostly they were eager to start the immigration process for Nancy, a Mexican national in order to legalize their partnership in the U.S.

        </blockquote>

        <br />
          <br />
        Just before new quarantine measures set in, Dan and Nany rearranged their plan and got married outside a park in the presence of the minister, two witnesses and a handful of friends.

          <br />
          <br />
        With restaurants closed they skipped the romantic dinner they had planned, grabbed a slice of Pizza at Costco (“Nancy's favourite shop”) and decided to stock up for the lockdown instead. In an effort to celebrate at least a little, the couple adjusted to the new situation: “We went to the Mexican barrio and bought a piñata, a corona piñata and got a bunch of candy and toilet paper inside the corona and beat the hell out of it”, Dan says.

              While Dan and Nancy were lucky enough to celebrate with a few friends present at the ceremony, elsewhere couples had to adjust to tighter social-distancing measures.

              A few weeks into President Trump’s travel ban, Germany imposed its own ban against a number of European countries, including Switzerland, where Jonas and Maria live. Getting to Germany, Jonas' homeland, wasn’t so much the problem, they qualified for <i>essential </i>travel. But the country had limited gatherings to a maximum of two people. Counting the couple, the translator and the registrar, the status of their civil wedding was pending.

            Relinquishing the presence of Maria’s family who was stuck in Lebanon was hard enough. But postponing would have been a bureaucratic nightmare.

        “We waited almost a year to get all our documents sorted", explained Maria. Documents had to be translated and each piece of paper accredited by the German embassy in Beirut.

        When the two eventually married at the end of March, they had to adhere to Germany’s new rules of ‘Kontaktverbot’. Just the couple was allowed inside the registry (“Standesamt”) with a glass dividing the two from the registrar.

              Even before the crisis, parents of international couples had to adjust to the reality of having to keep in touch with loved ones through their phones. As the virus started to creep up globally, parents and friends had an old acquaintance to rely on: a functioning internet connection.

              Following their daughter’s wedding through video call was the best Meghan’s parents could do. Meghan had left the U.K. in 2016 and came to work as a primary school teacher in Kenya, where she met Ronjey, a music teacher who taught at the same school in Nairobi.

              At 6am in the morning, U.K. time, Meghan got her dad, mum and 3 of her friends, all spread throughout the country from Wartling to Oxford on video call. In true British fashion, they watched with their cups of tea - her mum had a glass of wine - as their daughter and friend got married in Siyaa, a few meters away where Ronjey was born.

              As much as the wedding was a celebration for the newlywed couple, it was also a distraction for Megan’s family back in the U.K. “I think we made quite a few people’s day.”, Meghan said. “In the UK at that moment when everything was getting more and more unsettling and starting to go into lockdown, jobs stopped paying, to be able to send them all these photos, everyone was like: you made our day.”

              Despite the complications, Meghan and Ranjey were happy with how their ceremony went about. “We were looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, but ultimately it shows you that you’re doing it to get married rather than to have a big party”, Meghan says.

             The corona crisis has challenged international couples in unseen ways as countries put their national interest and those of their nationals first. Added government bureaucracy and travel restrictions left many only with the option to postpone.

              <br />

             But putting a pause on wedding plans can have bigger implications than just missing out on a party with friends and family. With the lessons learned during the pandemic and the heavy toll the crisis has put on especially those not in a position to stay together, it has shifted priorities. 


              <br />
              <br />

              For some couples it made them realize they want to get married sooner. 

              <br />
              <br />

              “I think the situation has made us want to get married because we have different passports and you know, being married legally, would make things easier if you're in the same country and have more rights in each other's countries”, says Simran, a Thai national.

              <br />
              <br />

              The experience of being separated and not enjoying the same rights can change things, like for Simran who has not seen her boyfriend since she left the U.K. and returned to Bangkok, because her visa was expiring.


              <br />
              <br />

              “Don't get me wrong. We both want to be together and get married anyway, but I think it would have been different if we both had the same nationality.”
